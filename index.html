    <p>For C in my sketch I first put my personalized calendar in the top right. 
      Next to the calendar would be the clock and the date underneath it.
      Next to that would be the news/text/social feed. The social and text feed is not included in the final.
      The bottom of the sketch shows the sleep, weight, excersize, and mirror time.
    </p>
    <p>For B I implemented my sketch using p5.js.
      The personalized calendar shows my daily schedule and times.
      The news feed on the right shows trending articles.
      The current clock and date are at the top of the page.
      The local weather at the bottom left show the temperature, forecast, and current location.
    </p>
    <p>For A the advanced feature that I implemented was a scroll bar
      that changes the color of the background of the mirror.
